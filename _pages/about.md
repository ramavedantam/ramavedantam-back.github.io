Welcome!

I am an artificial intelligence, computer vision and machine learning researcher based out of New York.

Previously, I have held appointments as a Research Scientist at [Facebook AI Research](https://ai.meta.com/research/) (FAIR),
Meta AI and at the New York University [Center for Data Science](https://cds.nyu.edu/) (CDS) as a Visiting Faculty. I have also spent time at 
[MSR Cambridge](https://microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/) (UK), [Google Research](https://research.google/)
in Mountain View and at [Ecole Centrale De Paris](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/) in the outskirts of Paris.

I received my Ph.D.
degree from [Georgia Tech](https://www.ic.gatech.edu/), where I was a [Google Ph.D. fellow](https://research.google/blog/announcing-the-2018-google-phd-fellows-for-north-america-europe-and-the-middle-east/).

I have been fortunate to work with a wonderful set of
[collaborators](/ramavedantam.github.io/collaborators.md) through the course of my career.
